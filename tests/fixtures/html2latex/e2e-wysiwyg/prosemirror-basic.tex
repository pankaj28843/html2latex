This is editable text. You can focus it and start typing.\par To apply styling,
you can select a piece of text and manipulate its styling from the menu. The basic
schema supports \textit{emphasis}, \textbf{strong text}, \href{http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog}{links},
\texttt{code font}, and

images.\par Block-level structure can be manipulated with key bindings (try ctrl-shift-2
to create a level 2 heading, or enter in an empty textblock to exit the parent
block), or through the menu.\par Try using the "list" item in the menu to wrap
this paragraph in a numbered list.\par \par
