\subsection{The three greatest things you learn from traveling}
Like all the great things on earth traveling teaches us by example. Here are some of the most precious
lessons I've learned over the years of traveling.\par

\subsubsection{Appreciation of diversity}
Getting used to an entirely different culture can be challenging. While it's also nice to learn
about cultures online or from books, nothing comes close to experiencing cultural diversity in person.
You learn to appreciate each and every single one of the differences while you become more
culturally fluid.\par

\subsubsection{Improvisation}
Life doesn't allow us to execute every single plan perfectly. This especially seems to be the case when
you travel. You plan it down to every minute with a big checklist. But when it comes to executing it,
something always comes up and you're left with your improvising skills. You learn to adapt as you go.
Here's how my travel checklist looks now:\par
\begin{itemize}
  \item buy the ticket

  \item start your adventure
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Confidence}
Going to a new place can be quite terrifying. While change and uncertainty make us scared, traveling
teaches us how ridiculous it is to be afraid of something before it happens. The moment you face your
fear and see there is nothing to be afraid of, is the moment you discover bliss.\par
