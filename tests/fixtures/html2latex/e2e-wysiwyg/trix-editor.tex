\section{Welcome to Trix}
\href{https://trix-editor.org/}{Trix} is a rich text editor for everyday writing. It's the editor that
powers \href{https://basecamp.com}{Basecamp} and \href{https://hey.com}{HEY}.\par
\subsection{What Makes Trix Different}
Most WYSIWYG editors are wrappers around HTML's \texttt{contenteditable} and \texttt{execCommand} APIs,
designed by Microsoft to support live editing of web pages in Internet Explorer 5.5.\par
\begin{quote}
  Trix sidesteps these inconsistencies by treating contenteditable as an I/O device: when input
  makes its way to the editor, Trix converts that input into an editing operation on its internal document
  model, then re-renders that document back into the editor.\par
\end{quote}
\subsection{Features}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A \textbf{document model} that handles text and attachments

  \item \textit{Undo and redo} that keeps your changes safe

  \item Native \underline{drag and drop} for images and files
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Code Example}
\begin{verbatim}<trix-editor input="content"></trix-editor>
